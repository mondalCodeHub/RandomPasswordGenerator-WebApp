## About the project 
This website application generates random passwords. JavaScript, CSS, and HTML were used to construct this web application. Here, users can create random passwords based on their preferences. For ease of use, I've included four check boxes, allowing the user to choose whether they want the created password to include all of the letters, numbers, and symbols.
